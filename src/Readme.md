In this project there are a few classes. With these classes we want to do some updates.
The goal of these updates is to understand a bit more about Access modifiers. This is an important aspect of Java.

**First step**

In the wordprinter file create a method print. This method has a string as input, and it will simply print this String. 
Then use this method in the main class and see if you can get it to print something.

**Second Step**

In the class Person some code has already been created. Create a person in the main class and give 
him/her/non-binary a name. Then print out that name

**Third Step**

You have successfully printed the name, now change the code a bit. The access modifier is set to public, please change 
it to private. Can you still assign the person a name and print it?
Ensure that you can do both.


**Some Cool shit**

Did you know that you can have multiple roles? You can be a person, but you can also be an experienced coder, 
or a son, or father. And your name would not change depending on the role you currently fulfill.

I have filled in a bit of code already in the IT Engineer class. Now it is up to you to create a new IT engineer and 
give it a name. You can do this by adding one line of code, no more is required. but how????
